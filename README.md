# Site Name: My Lesson 

Live Link [Create React App](https://my-lesson-5d129.web.app)

Basically I created an educational course related website.

I tried to build the site on Digital Marketing.

-Authentication was most important in this project.
-I used firebase for authentication.
-I used a private route on this site. Private route created for checkout page only.
-The site can be logged in using Google, GitHub and Email.
-Added dark and light theme for better user experience.
-The site built with React and React Router.
-I have used tailwind and daisyUi as css for this project.
-Created all the Course Data from the back end server.
-Server site deployed on vercel and the client site deployed on firebase.
